### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because this was the first lab where we used
    command line arguments. The program builds a sandwich with a set prompt
    where the user fills in the blank for bread, protein, and condiments.
    Experimenting with command line arguments and how we can produce different
    sandwich outputs depending on the user was a great experience. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because this lab tested your brain skills. In
    this lab, you must use if statements to determine where parking is allowed
    for multiple streets. Doing the math to see what time is and is not
    permitted, including deciding when to use and is in the if conditions,
    tests your problem-solving skills. Lab 7 Part 2 was the first lab that
    challenged me, making it memorable. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because this lab taught me new coding skills
    and the math needed to find the difference of days between two dates. The
    user would input two dates, and we need to convert the date to a day unit
    and subtract them from one another. Testing out different dates and seeing
    it print out dates instantly made me proud since this was something that I
    programmed and coded.
